# Test Graphs

## Format

Edgelist files have names of the form `*.edges`. Each line has an edge listed as a space seperated pair of vertex names (usually numbers)

Position files have names of the form `.pos`. Each line has a vertex name and two coordinates:

    <Vertex> <X-position> <Y-position>
